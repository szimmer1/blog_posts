<p>
    Generally, businesses are modeled in hierarchies. There's a CEO, Vice Presidents, General Managers, all the way down to the lowly engineers.
    But that's beside the point. Because of this feature of businesses, we often seek a way to model our data in hierarchical ways. Take,
    for example, a hierarchy of authorization groups. Group A and Group B have mutually exclusive sets of authorizations - A can enter lab A and B
    can enter lab B, but neither can enter each others' labs. Group C and D are part of Group A, but each have unique sets of permissions. So
    Group C has access to cabinet C only in lab A, and Group D has access to cabinet D only in lab A.
</p>

<p>
    Here's our simplest problem statement: <b>How do I find all the children of a given group</b>?
</p>

<p>
    To begin answering this question, we can model our hierarchy as a tree.<br>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.url }}/img/group_hierarchy.png" /><br>

    Each group can be modeled as an object with properties:
<pre><code>class Group
{
    Group parent;
    Permission[] perms;
}
</code></pre>
    In a relational database table, we could store each group object as a row in a <code>group</code> table:
<pre><code>+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| group_id | group_name | permissions | parent_group_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 1        | root       | ...         | null            |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 2        | A          | ...         | 1               |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 3        | B          | ...         | 1               |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 4        | C          | ...         | 2               |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 5        | D          | ...         | 2               |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 6        | E          | ...         | 3               |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 7        | F          | ...         | 3               |
+----------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
</code></pre>
    The more "relational" way to do this is create a separate <code>group_relationship</code> table where
    we can model all the different types of relationships between groups (parent, child, etc.), but for the purposes of this post
    our solution will allow us to reference just one table, as we'll soon see.
</p>

<h3>Naive approach</h3>
<p>
    The first naive approach that comes to mind is use a wrapper procedural language around SQL (let's use python), and write a
    simple database call <code>get_children(group_name)</code> that returns all the children groups of <code>group_name</code>.
    We'll call it from a recursive method:
<pre><code># returns a set of children group names
def get_all_children(group_name):
    children = set()
    for child_group_name in get_children(group_name):
        children |= get_all_children(child_group_name)
    return children
</code></pre>
    There's problem with this approach, though. It's not very I/O efficient. For every child found, there will be a network call to the database, so
    theoretically for a complete hierarchy tree of height h we'll have <i>O(2<sup>h</sup>)</i> I/O calls. For such a fundamental operation
    as retrieving authorization for a given user, in an enterprise application, this could be a significant performance drawback. So what if
    we accomplished the same task with one database call using SQL?
</p>

<h3>SQL approach</h3>
<p>
    We'd like to take a similar approach as before, only in SQL. In come <i>Common Table Expressions (CTE's)</i>, or in postgres, <code>WITH</code> queries.
    The [postgres doc]: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/queries-with.html "postgres docs" have a great resource on how these work, but I'll give a short overview here.
    <i>CTE's</i> are like sub-queries. Let's say we want the <b>user names of all members of lab groups (A or B)</b>. In postgres:
<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT u.user_name
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM group
    WHERE group_name in ('A','B')
) as l
JOIN user_group_relation r ON r.group_id=l.group_id
JOIN user u ON u.user_id=r.user_id;
</code></pre>
    is equivalent to:
<pre><code>WITH labs_only as (
    SELECT *
    FROM group
    WHERE group_name in ('A','B')
)
SELECT DISTINCT u.user_name from labs_only l
JOIN user_group_relation r ON r.group_id=l.group_id
JOIN user u ON u.user_id=r.user_id;
</code></pre>
    All we've done in this case is replace a sub-query aliased as <code>l</code> with a CTE named <code>labs_only</code>.
    But here's the cool part: CTE's can also refer to themselves, and this ability makes them a prime tool for recursion. Postgres has the descriptor keyword
    <code>RECURSIVE</code> reserved for the purpose. The structure of a <code>WITH RECURSIVE</code> query is like so:
<pre><code>WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
      [non-recursive term]
    UNION / UNION ALL
      SELECT [recursive term f(n)] FROM t WHERE [condition]
)
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
     Finally, here's our solution to the group hierarchy problem:
<pre><code>WITH RECURSIVE recursive_group AS (
     SELECT *
     FROM group
     WHERE group_name='A'
    UNION
     SELECT g.*
     FROM group g, recursive_group rg
     WHERE g.parent_group_id=rg.group_id
)
SELECT group_name from recursive_group;
</code></pre>
     Here's a commentary of what's happening:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Declare the CTE <code>recursive_groups</code> as recursive
            </li>
            <li>
                Initialize the non-recursive value as the row representing group 'A'
            </li>
            <li>
                Perform a union on the 'building table' started by the non-recursive value, and the table
                returned by the recursive value. In the recursive value <code>WHERE</code> clause, our condition
                is that the previous group's id should equal the next group's parent_id
            </li>
        </ol>
     CTE recursion isn't classical recursion, it's actually an iterative reduction. But
        for the sake of semantics, SQL calls it recursion and we do too.
</p>

<h4>Pitfalls</h4>
<p>
    One possible pitfall is if two groups are each others' parents. This creates a circular path in the tree
    resulting in an infinite loop on the database.
</p>

<h3>A thought on business logic</h3>
<p>
    As Martin Fowler writes in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, "there are few things more illogical than 'business logic'".
    It is a natural jump for business people to have Group D access some area of lab A, only on Tuesdays, and when revenue growth is below 50%.
    While our hierarchy model doesn't totally break down, as software engineers we have to be wary of customizations to our oversimplified rules.
    These "outlets" to plug logic into have to be built in from day one, or they cause big problems down the road.
