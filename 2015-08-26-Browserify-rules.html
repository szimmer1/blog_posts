        <p>
            While I was developing some client javascript today, I came across a situation where I wanted server-side directory
            information in my client javascript. Specifically, I needed to refer to a static html template from some Angular
            directive code.
            </p>
        <h3>Directory structure</h3>
<pre><code>root
    - ng
        - dist
            - js
                - my_app
                      my_app_bundle.js
                    - partials
                          directive_template.html
        - src
            - js
                - my_app
                      my_app_controllers.js
                      my_app_services.js
                      my_app_directives.js
                      my_app.js
                    - partials
                          directive_template.html
</code></pre>
        <p>
            I do all my development on files in the src directory, and have a <code>gulp watch</code> process using <b>Browserify</b>  to
            compile the source
            files into the dist/my_app_bundle.js file, as well as copying any html files with from the src/ directory into dist/ with
            the same exact directory structure.
        </p>
        <h3>Directive code</h3>
<pre><code>angular.module('myapp.directives', [])
        .directive('myDirective', function() {
            return {
                templateUrl: "/ng/dist/js/my_app/partials/directive_template.html",
                link: function(scope, ele) {
                    // link fn code
                }
            }
        })
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Here you can see the <code>templateUrl</code> hardcoded.
            This is an easy solution in the moment. But it sucks in the long run - it's not resistant to directory structure changes and prone
            to bugs.
        </p>
        <h3>The solution</h3>
<pre><code>angular.module('myapp.directives', [])
        .directive('myDirective', function() {
            return {
                templateUrl: __dirname + "/partials/directive_template.html",
                link: function(scope, ele) {
                    // directive code
                }
            }
        })
</code></pre>
<p>
    During browserify compilation, <br><code>__dirname + '/partials/directive_template.html'</code> <br>is compiled to<br>
    <code>'/ng/dist/js/my_app' + '/partials/directive_template.html'</code>
</p>
        <p>
            Browserify re-uses the Node.js module system. I knew this, and wondered whether Browserify would also know about
            Node.js-like globals. Turns out it does! I thought that was cool enough to write a blog post on.
        </p>
